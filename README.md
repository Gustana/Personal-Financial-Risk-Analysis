# Objective
In this notebook, I analyzed [a dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/preethamgouda/financial-risk) of Personal Financial Risk.

The main objective of this project is to create visualizations that will help readers understand personal financial risk.

# Analysis
To meet the defined objective, I explored the dataset by answering the following questions:
1. What's the `sum of loan based on education level and risk rating`
2. What's the `average of debt-to-income ratio grouped by employment status and risk rating`
3. What's the `average assets based on educational level and risk rating`
4. What's the `proportion of high financial risk rating by age band`
5. What's the `proportion of low financial risk rating by age band`
6. What's the `distribution of DTI Ratio by high & low risk ratings`

# Insights
These are insights that obtained in this project:
- People who have **high total loan amount and assets tend to have a low financial risk rating.**
- The average of Debt-to-Income Ratios are almost identical across all age groups, regardless of whether individuals are unemployed, self-employed, or employed.
- Age band 45-59 has the highest proportion on high financial rating by 31%
- Age band 30-44 has the highest proportion on low financial rating by 32%
- DTI ratio doesn't affect risk rating

**Recommendation**
> Individuals needs to increase their total assets and learn to manage their loan, so they can generate more revenue which can lead to decrease their financial risk rating.
